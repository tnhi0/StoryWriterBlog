                <p>Hello, I'm Insra. I'm an IT student, and currently based in Vietnam.</p>
                <p>I have always liked making up stories and drawing, and so I admire a lot of manga (and later, when I know better to look up their author - mangaka). </p>
                <p>I started drawing webcomic in 2019 on Webtoon and Tapas. After some break since entering college, I thought I want to try my hand to write other people's story (Things happens in my life that make me realize it's important). </p>
                <p>And here I am. Please to make your acquaintance and I hope I can help you tell and remember your story.</p>

            <p>Because I tend to do long, drawn-out work, it usually takes about 1 month roughly.</p>
