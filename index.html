                <p>Hello, I'm Insra. I'm an IT student, and currently based in Vietnam.</p>
                <p>I have always liked making up stories and drawing, and so I admire a lot of manga (and later, when I know better to look up their author - mangaka). </p>
                <p>I started drawing webcomic in 2019 on Webtoon and Tapas. After some break since entering college, I thought I want to try my hand to write other people's story (Things happens in my life that make me realize it's important). </p>
                <p>And here I am. Please to make your acquaintance and I hope I can help you tell and remember your story.</p>

            <h2>Timeline</h2>
            <p>Because I tend to do long, drawn-out work, it usually takes about 1 month roughly.</p>
            <p>This is what I've done with my previous project and it worked pretty well:</p>
            <table class="timeline-table">
                <tr>
                    <th>Phase</th>
                    <th>Details</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Initial Agreement</td>
                    <td>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Set the project budget: How much can you spend on this project?</li>
                            <li>Set the project timeline: When is the deadline? Is it a hard or soft deadline?</li>
                        </ul>
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>First Meeting</td>
                    <td>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Tell me the story that you want to tell
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Who are the characters in your story? What are they like?</li>
                                    <li>What is the main feeling that you want to convey?</li>
                                    <li>Why do you want to tell this story? Is this something that you have thought of for a while?</li>
                                    <li>What is the vibe that you want the story to give off? (chill, formal, wholesome, blue... you can describe it anyway you want)</li>
                                    <li>What music do you want the story to be like? I think music is a very good way to specify complex feelings. If there are any songs like that for you, please tell me!</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>We would sort out these things as well:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Where will we communicate? When and how often do we do revisions?</li>
                                    <li>How and when will the project be financed? (Usually 2 times: at project start and end)</li>
                                    <li>When is the deadline? How long will the project last?</li>
                                    <li>Are there any other materials necessary for the project? (photos...)</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Project Timeline</td>
                    <td>Then I will create a timeline of the project and send it to you. Each week, I'll update the progress of the project and we will meet once a week for revision. Then we wrap things up.</td>
